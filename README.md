This application shows how to use a collaboration between a setTimeout scheduler and the Web Audio scheduler to properly implement rock-solid timing for audio applications.

Check it out, feel free to submit issues or requests, fork, submit pull requests, etc.

The live app is at http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/metronome/index.html.
